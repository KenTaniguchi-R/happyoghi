## Inspiration
This project is inspired by the trouble that Yolo Food Bank encounters, which is managing tons of food and their nutritional information. We tried to make the process of managing and checking the nutritional information easier by utilizing QR code and object oriented programming.

## What it does
User can create a container that holds multiple food items such as apples and oranges, as well as their quantities. Then, after confirming the creation of the container, it will generate a QR code for easier access to the specific page that shows the details of the container. User can also easily print out the QR code and stick it on the actual cardboard box. Users can edit the contents of a container later, and do not need to worry about the QR code. The same QR code will take you to the updated page!

## How we built it
Built with Django for speedy work.
